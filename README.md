- Here is the Explanation of the code

1. The code defines a class named `CombinationFinder`.
2. The `findSumPairs` method takes an array of integers `nums` and a target value and returns a 2D array of pairs whose absolute sum is equal to the target value. It iterates over the array using nested loops and checks if the absolute sum of the current pair matches the target. If a pair is found, it checks if it is already present in the `pairs` list to avoid duplicates. If not, it adds the pair to the `pairs` list. Finally, it converts the list of pairs to a 2D array and returns it.
3. The `mergeArray` method takes a 2D array of integers and merges it into a single sorted 1D array. It iterates over each subarray and adds its elements to a list. Then, it converts the list to a 1D array, sorts it, and returns the sorted array.
4. The `doubleTarget` method takes an integer target and returns its doubled value.
5. The `findCombinations` method takes an array of integers `nums` and a target value. It initializes an empty list named `combinations` to store the combinations. It sorts the `nums` array and then calls the `backtrack` method to perform a depth-first search to find combinations whose sum is equal to the target. It creates a 2D array `result` and populates it with the combinations found. Finally, it returns the `result` array.
6. The `backtrack` method is a helper method used by `findCombinations` to perform the depth-first search. It takes the `nums` array, the remaining target value, the current index `start`, the current combination, and the list of combinations. If the remaining target reaches zero, it means a combination with the desired sum has been found, so it adds a copy of the current combination to the `combinations` list. Otherwise, it explores all possible combinations by iterating over the numbers starting from the `start` index. It skips duplicates to avoid duplicate combinations and breaks the loop if a number is already greater than the remaining target. It recursively calls itself with the updated parameters after adding the current number to the combination. After the recursive call returns, it removes the last number from the current combination to backtrack and try other possibilities.
7. The `main` method is the entry point of the program. It defines an array `nums` and a target value. It first calls the `findSumPairs` method to find pairs whose sum is equal to the target and prints them. Then, it calls the `mergeArray` method to merge the pairs into a single sorted array and prints it. Finally, it doubles the target value and calls the `findCombinations` method to find combinations whose sum is equal to the doubled target and prints them.
